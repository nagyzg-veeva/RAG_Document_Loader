Job ID: 3dbd43f8-bea1-428e-a

We are getting the following error in our Migration Task for 'Data Transformation'. We are not sure if this is an issue or not but wanted to flag to better understand. Appears to have to do with HTML reports based on the log error:

com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.csv.CsvWriteException: Unrecognized column 'object_recordtype__v': known columns: [""application_profile__v"",""created_date__v"",""description__v"",""external_id__v"",""html_report_status__v"",""id"",""legacy_crm_id__v"",""modified_date__v"",""name__v"",""object_recordtype_id__v"",""object_type__v.api_name__v"",""ownerid__v.legacy_crm_id__v"",""platform__v"",""profile__v"",""publish_process_timestamp__v"",""publish_status_details__v"",""review_before_submit__v"",""sharing_group__v"",""studio_id__v"",""studio_version__v"",""visibility_criteria__v""] (through reference chain: java.util.HashMap[""object_recordtype__v""])

We believe this is causing issues in Data because we are getting object records that are being extracted but are not being loaded in, and not coming in our Results for Data ETL. Here are some examples of objects that have records that are not coming over and also not failing:
-Clinical Trial
-Product Catalog
-CLM Presentation
-Remote Meeting
-Clinical Trial
-Product Catalog
-Approved Document

Because these items are not coming in we are seeing issues in Data ETL Data Load.

DCR Field Type records in Vault CRM are just copied/pasted from Veeva CRM:

1 - Object names remains ""Account"" / ""Address_vod__c"" / ""Child_account_vod__c"" as in SFDC (not account__v, address__v, child_account__v). 

2 - CRM Field Api Names are the same as the one in CRM e.g: Gender_vod__c is not translated to ""gender__v""

11/7: Ultimately this means that the DCR Field Types are meaningless because it references the SFDC objects/object names instead of the Vault CRM objects/objects. Network Settings and bridge mappings appear to be fine.

This is relevant for all customers where Data has been run. Using Immunovant for Example. The error is: Error Type INVALID_DATA Invalid value(s) [a0Z8c00000SArkfEAD] specified for parameter [replacement_message__v.legacy_crm_id__v] : Object field value(s) do not resolve to a valid active [replacement_message__v.legacy_crm_id__v];Error Type INVALID_DATA Invalid value(s) [a0Z8c00000SArkeEAD] specified for parameter [original_message__v.legacy_crm_id__v] : Object field value(s) do not resolve to a valid active [original_message__v.legacy_crm_id__v];

After investigation, we can confirm the Veeva Message does in fact exist, however it does not have Legacy SFDC ID. This seems to be because the Veeva Message already existed prior to migrator and thus was ignored/skipped. Because of this no Legacy SFDC ID is provided and it cannot be mapped. Seems like an issue where the Legacy SFDC ID should be upserted instead

Error: The issue around cascading has been resolved, however it appears we are missing a standard override for the Object Type of Hopsital Department for Account Overview Layout. We are getting the below issue, because there is an additional character in the api name:

ISO 639 standard for language classification. This list is a subset of the ISO 639 language
codes""


Some languages are mapped in the bridge but not included in the selection list, for example : 
- Yiddish (yi)
- Punjabi, Panjabi (pa)
...

Item-152,Data errors are high effort to fix manually; need a a better solution to remediate,Sandor,8. Resolved,,2 Medium,Migrator,Enhancement,ETL - Data,"In cases where Data ETL returns with an error code, which cannot be fixed, there would be a need for manually fixing the records and data loading them. However the current ETL error log only gives the record id, and the error code. So currently the way to do this is: extract records from Salesforce, map the fields, map the picklist values, fix the object type references, fix the date format and fix our inital issues that was highlighted in the error code. This process is very time consuming and error prone.

For services to be able to fix these items, we would need the full record csv with the correct vault field and value mapping, for the records that have failed. So the only manual item to do would be to fix the issue highlighted in the error column

Example: call discussion records in the data error file for Santhera

The API name of the picklist may be wrong -- logging into Vault CRM, the picklist should be ""type__v"" not ""message_type__v"". The picklist has an active value for ""Label"" and does not have object types enabled.

JH 11/14 Additional Context: Upon digging into this further for Inhibrx, we are learning that this will be an issue across all customers. SFDC does not have the concept of Record Type OLS outside of create and it seems like the current version of Migrator does not take that consideration into account. Please see example:
-In Salesforce an Inhibrx Permission Set (INBRX ACCOUNT BASELINE) grants OLS R/E to the Account object and grants record type access to the Professional_vod and Institution_vod objects. What this means in Salesforce:
-User Assigned will be able to Create Accounts of record type Institution, and Professional (as long as they have C on a different PS or profile). User is able to see and edit all other Accounts of all record types, not just professional/institution
-In Vault CRM, the migrator creates the same INBRX ACCOUNT BASELINE permission set, but the OLS is set at the Record Type level, rather than the Object Type level. So they have R/E to Institution and Professional only.
-This means users assigned will only be able to Read/Edit those specific Record Types, any other Account with Record Type different than Professional/Institution they will not be able to see.
-The workaround is to grant r/e OLS to all other record types in Vault. This will need to be done across all objects that have record types.
-Ideal state would be to only grant create ols to the record type if a ps grants record type access in salesforce, if user gets R or E OLS, it should apply to all object types, to align with how salesforce works today",,Cannot determine the extent of the issues resulting because they aren't in the logs.,"Inhibrx, Almac","11/12: [AF} This is applicable to Inhibrx as well.

Alfasigma has Key Messages with Content that was loaded directly into CRM. During Migration, it appears that Migrator creates these Key Messages with Files uploaded in the 'Media' section, but the files are empty. It would be good to understand if Migrator will be able to handle this in the future.

Workaround:
1) For Files < 50mb. Find Key Message in Salesforce, download Media, find Key Message in Vault CRM and upload Content into Media Section (note may need to add media section to Key Message Layout in Vault CRM)

There are two parts to this issue:
1) Align is populating the 'Legacy MAID' instead of the actual one. This will be fixed in 4.40 release.
2) For Territory, another part of the issue depends on CRM. CRM has two fields: master_align_id_vod__c and master_align_id__v. During migration, we only had access to the first field, which is why we populated it. CRM is implementing a fix in 5.10 to allow Align to access the correct field, and so will Align. CRM jira is tracked here: https://jira.veevadev.com/browse/VCRM-58674

You see duplicates because MAID is the unique key. If an immediate fix is needed, the master_align_id__v field must be manually populated

2025-04-01 Notes:

For the latest run of the migrator, I still had to manually update the Territory MAID in CRM (i.e. master_align_id__v) with the Territory MAID in Align instead of the Legacy MAID. ","For MAID data fix - https://jira.veevadev.com/browse/VCRM-62844

Vault CRM Record ID",,,Shionogi NA,"- Notice that the ""Vault CRM Record ID"" for these accounts are blank in Align. As a short-term fix, please populate it manually
- Identified that around 700 records did not have the Vault CRM Record ID populated. And, also noticed that approximately 700 records encountered errors during the initial CRM migration

Following up with Services, they confirmed that these records were not migrated, due to primary parent being an issue.

Hence, Align could not populate the Vault CRM Record ID for these records. Align can only populate the Vault CRM Record ID if CRM migrates these records.

Please note that I had to fix some of the data already due to project deadline.
In case of custom fields, which are picklist in CRM but Text in Align, the tool does not update the value on the align records.
I saw this issue when I was checking the Account Criteria records and atleast Accounts, Addresses and Product Metrics are impacted.
For example: Account's custom GSK Status picklist:
Label in Salesforce: Active      API name in Salesforce: Active        Value in Veeva Align's text field: Active             Value on the Rule Criteria record: Active
Label in Vault CRM: Active      API in Vault CRM: active__c              Value in Vault CRM Align's text field: Active      Value on the Rule Criteria record in Vault CRM Align: active__c
By this, the account not applies to the rule anymore and the related account-territory assignments will be end dated.
",https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f6ZZR-gEkeE5AvEGHv_iSpZ_hsZDGNUx?usp=sharing,,GSK ViiV,"There are two issues with picklist-to-text mappings:

The rules contain field values as ""abc__c"", whereas the text field itself is migrated as ""abc"" (since Align does not currently perform any queries on field mapping; it simply migrates the field assuming it is a text field, which typically requires no conversion).
This will be fixed by first jira, ensuring that ""__c"" is appended to the ""text"" data - targeted for .21

In the rules, the conversion logic currently appends ""_c"" to all picklist values. However, there is no logic to determine whether the picklist in CRM contains ""c"" or ""v"" values. The issue here is that during the next CRM run, the data will be updated to ""cdev"", but the rules will still reference ""cde_c"", causing a mismatch.
This is a more significant issue and requires querying CRM metadata to determine which values use ""_v"" vs. ""_c"". When we fix this issue, the ""__v"" suffix should be added to both the ""text"" field and the ""rule criteria"" to ensure consistency - planned for 5.30 ","For __c picklists

Territory: 110099999",,,Shionogi NA,"For RMT:

- This is fixed in the 5.10 release. The issue was caused because the ""name__v"" field on the RMT object (which is rosterid_territoryid) serves as the unique key for the object. Currently, this field is incorrectly populated with Legacy IDs. After the fix, the CRM push will no longer cause duplicates.
- As a short-term fix, the issue can be addressed immediately by manually updating the ""name__v"" field on the object

For MSP

MSP relies on IS2 records. If an IS2 record with the given Vault CRM Record ID does not exist in CRM, Align will attempt to create it again, which leads to duplicate records. Therefore, we should not delete IS2 records from the target instance unless they have a blank Vault CRM Record ID (which has also been fixed in version 4.40)",https://jira.veevadev.com/browse/VCRM-66592,Align 243.5.10, 13 Mar 25,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,,03/05/2025,04/08/2025,34,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJLdhSol4tqnIdeMg9uGSjC98h3V_sFGcAkAbJUBpp4/edit?gid=2069077045#gid=2069077045&range=39:39,39

However, CRM does not ""accept"" the value 'F2F' during the push process. I assume it expects the picklist value name 'f2f__c'.

This behavior is different from the Vault Loader behavior where the system recognizes and accepts 'F2F' as a valid value for the picklist (I've tested it and Vault Help also states this - see auto-formatting).

https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/26607/#auto-formatting

Question: can you confirm the behavior during the push process is expected? If yes, then we need to do some adjustment e.g. change the text field in Align to a picklist.","Not a migrator issue, more of a Vault platform question.","MCCPs not getting pushed to CRM.

We can circumvent this limitation by removing the field from the outbound mapping which enables us to continue testing but this is not a solution for production.",Bayer - GDO,"This is expected behavior. The data stored in the backend always corresponds to the API names; hence, the text field data must match the API name in the CRM to successfully push the data.

- Discrepancies between the user__sys file generated from CRM and what Align expects. As a result, the Record ID was not populated, causing an error during the push

- There is another related known issue: https://jira.veevadev.com/browse/VCRM-66416. Only caused when a master_align_id_vod__C is mapped to master_align_id__aln on Parent HCO   (caused by CRM issue - https://jira.veevadev.com/browse/VCRM-58674)

- Identified the issue, Vault CRM migrations do not transfer ObjectTerritory2Association objects to account_territory_v if they have 'Master_Align_Id_vod_c' set. As a result, we cannot populate the Vault CRM Record ID for these records. The short-term approach is to delete these IS2 records that are missing Vault CRM Record IDs, which should resolve the issue with the push to CRM. This is NOT A BLOCKER

Both fields allow values between 0-99 in Align while in CRM they can be between -99 and +99.
Taking an example where we want to set under reached to -10% and over reached to +5%: this means we need to set Under Reached Threshold=10 and Over Reached Threshold=5 which is blocked by the Align validation while it is allowed in CRM and it seems to be a valid business case.
I think we shouldn't have this validation for the 2 fields, but they should be independent. NB, this has been a long-standing behavior in Align but it is misleading and blocks certain pairs of values. I can set for example 10-10 in the two fields, or 5-10, but not 10-5 as shown in the above example.
I think the confusion comes from two similar Align fields: Upper Utilization Threshold and Lower Utilization Threshold where the values in the fields represent the ""absolute"" boundaries of the acceptable range in percentages (i.e. utilization must be between 95 and 115% of the capacity), while the values in the under/over reached threshold fields represent the deviation from the baseline 100% (e.g. (-)10% and (+)5%). It makes sense to have such a validation in the former case but not in the latter.","Support ticket has been created:

Newer migrations have this in line with GDV QA.

Item-281,Translation of Page Layout sections (detail section) missing,Sandor,8. Resolved,,1 High,Migrator,Issue,Translation,"When Migrating translations for Page Layouts, in the migrator log there is errors (see below), which do not make sense. What is causing this issues? If I manually load these section translations, i do not face any issues

line 11,569: Translation of ""layout.rep_address_layout_nwk__c#address_types__c.sectionLabel"" not supported

In addition, certain Layout sections are not translated in Vault CRM, and they aren't in the log file as failure. Example key: bc_comm_professional_layout__c#key_indicators__c for French language

Lastly, salesforce generated sections example: ""System Information"" are not translated according to the standard SF translations. Example key: bc_comm_professional_layout__c#system_information__c for French language

This is causing a significant amount of translation work, between extracting from Salesforce, transforming it to Vault Translation file format, Loading translations. Especially because in Vault the translation of the related list needs to be specified on each layout that the related list is used on (in salesforce it is defined on the object level)

Item-314,Veeva CRM lookup fields which have lookup filter filtering on Account IDs are creating duplicate fields in Vault CRM.,Arthur Lemerle,0. Rejected,,2 Medium,Migrator,Issue,ETL - Metadata,"Customer: Bayer (GDV org)
Job ID: V60000000029006
Vault ID: 262911

Veeva CRM lookup fields which have lookup filter filtering on Account IDs are creating duplicate fields in Vault CRM.

Example:

In Veeva CRM we have:
BPH_Opportunity_Line_Item__c.BPH_Ship_To__c 
-> Lookup field to Account_vod__c object

BPH_Opportunity_Line_Item__c.BPH_Address__c 
-> Lookup field to Address_vod__c object
-> with lookup filter ""Opportunity Line Item: Ship To ID equals Address: Account ID"" (meaning only Addresses linked to Account added to Ship To field can be selected in Address for the Opportunity Line record).

After migration in Vault CRM we have:
bph_opportunity_line_item__c.bph_ship_to__c
-> Object field to Account__v object

bph_opportunity_line_item__c.ctrl_account__c
-> Controlling field for bph_opportunity_line_item__c.bph_address__c
-> Object field to Account__v object

bph_opportunity_line_item__c.bph_address__c
-> Object field to addres__v object
-> Controlled by field bph_opportunity_line_item__c.ctrl_account__c

It should have been: 
-> bph_opportunity_line_item__c.bph_address__c field controlled by bph_opportunity_line_item__c.bph_ship_to__c field
Or
-> bph_opportunity_line_item__c.bph_address__c with a VQL criteria to filter for ""bph_address__c.account__v = bph_ship_to__c""

At the moment end-users will have to populate 2 fields with the same value any time they are creating a record. + poor UX.

Novo's Data Loading Job has 17 objects that do not mention Data Load Success/Error counts but it appears records were extracted. (account__v, address__v, and 15 more objects).

Item-282,Translation of Page Layout sections (Related lists) missing,Sandor,8. Resolved,,1 High,Migrator,Issue,Translation,"When Migrating translations for Page Layouts, the translation of related list are not carried over, and they are not indicated in the logs either.

My assumption is because of platform difference that is not accounted for:
1. In Salesforce, related lists translations are based on the Object Name/Tab translation by default and can be additionally translated on the object level (e.g. how the Call related list should be translated across any layouts for the Account object) 

2. In Vault CRM, each layout section (incl. related lists) can be individually translated. Migrator does not account for these, meaning that on all layouts the related list labels are all in English

This is causing a significant amount of translation work, between extracting from Salesforce, transforming it to Vault Translation file format, Loading translations. Especially because in Vault the translation of the related list needs to be specified on each layout that the related list is used on (in salesforce it is defined on the object level)

Job ID:
e488ee55-e474-459c-a

BI has added ignores for Profiles and Objects and run discovery. Despite the profiles and objects being on the ignore list, the discovery report is still flagging items that relate like fields on the object or View All/Modify All for objects related to the profile.

Example 1: Profile on Ignore list - related discovery items
Example 2: Custom object on Ignore List - related discovery items

More importantly, the ignored items are then appearing in the Metadata ETL as failures.

Example: Custom object BI_ICP_KAM_insight__c on the ignore list causing failure in MD log due to number of custom objects 500 exceeds [max: 500]

Please can you confirm that ignoring an object should automatically ignore any related fields and ignoring a profile should also ignore any related premissions for that profile during a discovery or MD ETL?

From Salesforce the whole Profile-RecordType and Layout Matrix is translated and migrated to Layout Profile Assignments. This is causing a large matrix in Layout Profiles, and the UI becomes slow to do manual adjustments

If there is a single Layout for an Object in Salesforce, Migrator should not create a Layout Profile Assignment for any of the Profiles. As this assignment is redundant. 

This change should also take into that Vault automatically creates a Layout for an Object. So Migrator should set the Migrated Layout from Salesforce as the Default for these Objects.

We noticed that custom objects, that our Tech Services need to rebuild the Marketing Cloud Integration, were not migrated. There is no track of them in logs. 

Is Migrator by default ignoring objects that were in Managed Packages?

Example Objects: 
et4ae5__IndividualEmailResult__c: tracking record that is containing: send time, open time, bounce flags, number of clicks etc.
et4ae5__IndividualLink__c: Within the context of an individual email send to an HCP, and related to the IndividualEmailResult record, this object contains an entry per link that is clicked by an individual HCP, how many times it was clicked by that HCP and when it was last clicked.
et4ae5__SendDefinition__c: For each Email/Email Journey going out from Salesforce Marketing Cloud, a general header record is created in this object in Veeva CRM/Salesforce, as the umbrella record. This record is not visible in the UI of Veeva CRM/Salesforce, but functions as a master record on datamodel level.

31 May: Services will handle this.

10/31: Clinigen has their own Expense data model--data includes many attachments but it's not in ""Notes & Attachments"" but are actual files (""Advanced Notes and Files""). The files are not migrated to Vault CRM.

The problem with Attachment Extraction.  it seems extraction works only for field storage records with record type= Attachment. However there're a lot of records with the record type = Content Bodies. These records are visible under Veeva CRM as Files . When Veeva run the projects of migration to Veeva CRM to Lightning we adviced customers to migrate their Attachments to Files. in the result we've got a lot of customers who moved old style attachments to Fils ( i.e. Content Bodies ) which apparently are not extracted and then not loaded Vault CRM

Screenshot link showing 6 attachments and 1375 Content bodies ( incl. Files) - only 6 attachment were extracted

Currently the Attachment Field ETL job is holding us back from being able to succesfuly finish the customer domain's full sbx migration run.

Item-318,"Overrides for SFDC Long text fields that are 32,768",Mimi,8. Resolved,,2 Medium,Migrator,Enhancement,ETL - Metadata,"No job ID - all customers impacted

Long text field default in SFDC is 32,768 but the limit in Vault is 32,000. Currently we have been making these attachment fields which is NOT ideal for customers as the text will fit in 32,000.
Migrator is set to flag these and services is looking at tooling to potentially update them in SFDC but not all customers can do that without it taking months.

Request is for migrator tool to allow us to override the field types.
Option 1 (preferred): Migrator will automatically shorten the fields that are 32,768 to 32,000 and leave the fields as long text.  We would then add overrides for any fields that we ACTUALLY want to become attachment fields
Option 2: Migrator will automatically convert those fields to attachment fields and services will add to the overrides the individual fields where we want them truncated to 32,000 and to remain long text

31 May: Mike Pay is building a tool to analyse SFDC for fields that are 32,768 and check if any records would be truncated should the field be reduced to 32,000 characters. The output of this tool should be a csv of overrides to load into Migrator that override the field length for the field to 32,000 characters. Nastya to confirm that field length override will be possible and what the syntax should be. NOTE: whilst Pavi's script worked ok on small orgs, they fail when tested on large data sets (e.g. BI Child 1 org). Mike needs to bulkify the approach before we can publish on the tools portal - challenging given the SFDC api's so will take time.",,,All,,https://jira.veevadev.com/browse/VCRM-90222,251.4.10, 10 Jul 25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,05/20/2025,07/11/2025,52,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJLdhSol4tqnIdeMg9uGSjC98h3V_sFGcAkAbJUBpp4/edit?gid=1022515905#gid=1022515905&range=42:42,42

In the discovery report under the type ""Picklist - Custom Picklist Value with ""vod"" naming convention"", there are a number of picklist values that are incorrectly flagged.

The mapping file would not have shown these inactive values, and Migrator would not see them either. When attempting to load these values, the MDL failed.

It looks like CRM ensures user_territory__v record uniqueness via the uniqueness of the external_id__v value, however, the field is blank on migrated records. Thus I can create a duplicate of a migrated record manually. (Align is capable of matching the existing records even with blank external ID and does not create duplicates.)

Expected behavior: the CRM migrator populates the external ID field on user_territory__v records with the user ID and territory ID in the 23174946.VCRZ0000000VOL5 format. It seems there is a trigger performing this but it is likely switched off during migrator data load.

Is the migrator tool supposed to be assigning actions to object types on all relevant Objects? An example here is Record a Call, New Medical Inquiry, Account Timeline, not being available for end users because these actions are not enabled at the Object Type Level

The actions ""Create Medical Inquiry"" and ""Create Medical Insight"" are not enabled for the object type. If a user has the ability to create these - it should automatically be enabled on the object type.

As an initial analysis we identified that the possible cause is that the TSF records in Veeva CRM are assigned to wrong addresses in the 'Preferred Address' relationship, so the migrator might have consider the account related to the preferred address instead of the actual TSF related account.
As an example: The TSF ""Territory-A"" is linked to the account ""Dr. John"", however, this TSF address (Preferred Address lookup) has an address that belongs to ""Dr. Michael"". The same TSF for the ""Territory-A"" is now in Vault CRM associated to ""Dr. Michael"" and not to ""Dr. John"" as it should be.

The the cause mentioned in the description could be possible because of the controlling field. In the vault side, the ""account_v"" field is the controlling field of ""address_v"". Therefore, to make sure the controlling dependency work, we will set the account according to what the address pointing to. 

Some details in the case, we extract these fields from SFDC: ""Account_vod_c, Address_vodc, Address_vodr.Account_vod_c"".

According to the rules in VCRM-13725: the controlling field value should be set based on the child/controlled relationship to the parent. Therefore, if there is a value from ""Address_vod_r.Account_vod_c"", we will prioritize the value when setting for the account. This is to make sure we can load the data without any controlling dependency issues.

So the cause mentioned in the description could be possible. If they are assigned to wrong addresses, the migrator will set the account which the address points to, instead of the actual TSF account.

The only path forward I see is to ignore the address reference field. 

Example: Account id = 1 has multiple addresses (children ids 11, 12, 13). 11 is the one that customer wants to reference on account id 1, this means controlling field will have to be set to id =1, we get an error: record cannot reference itself;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,1,,12/06/2025,,28,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJLdhSol4tqnIdeMg9uGSjC98h3V_sFGcAkAbJUBpp4/edit?gid=1022515905#gid=1022515905&range=404:404,404

MDL Type: Object, Error: '[Picklist] value is expected' is received during Metadata ETL. There is no 'Picklist' type of failure, so I'm not sure if a picklist value is causing the issue. This happened after adding new ignores and overrides to the migration. We had some incorrect overrides in the previous run (BMS GFFA P0 run 2), fixed those, but the issue is still there. The first run did not have these issues (BMS GFFA P0 run1). Looking at the MDLs that failed, the picklist fields are not created on 2 objects. There are 18K NOT_PROCESSED Picklistentry items, but I could not find the reason why they are not processed.

Item-436,Updating Roster member record in UAT before the integration,Tsubasa,0. Rejected,,1 High,Vault CRM,Question,Users,"We are currently preparing the Align UAT instance for our customer. 

Is there any issue if we update the Vault CRM Instance data and the Email Address field simultaneously by appending .invalid to the email address in Align UAT?

VCRM users who are currently in ""Pending"" status will become active once they are integrated from Align.
However, the users will not receive a welcome email because their email address is set to xxx@xxx.invalid.

Is my understanding correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12/11/2025,,23,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJLdhSol4tqnIdeMg9uGSjC98h3V_sFGcAkAbJUBpp4/edit?gid=1022515905#gid=1022515905&range=406:406,406
